# Mask-Detection-using-Google-Colab
During this pandemic people are coming with various new and creative ideas to tackle Covid-19. One such idea is to detect whether a person is wearing mask or not at public places or at their workplaces. This has been made possible with the help of Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
This notebook took inspiration from one such [PROJECT](https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection/) by Chandrika Deb.
This is a Google colab implementation of Face Mask detection project.
